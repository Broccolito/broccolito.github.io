\title{Cell Type Ontology Annotations (CL)}
\format{
A data frame with 3,058 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the CL (Cell Ontology) identifier (e.g., "CL:0000001").}
\item{name}{The standardized name of the cell type (e.g., "primary cultured cell").}
\item{definition}{A textual definition of the cell type, including functional roles, structural features, and biological context. Obsolete terms are clearly indicated.}
}

\usage{

}
\description{
A structured annotation table of cell types based on the Cell Ontology (CL). This dataset provides standardized identifiers, names, and detailed biological definitions for various cell types, including epithelial cells, immune cells, and specialized sensory cells.
It is used in the tKOI framework to annotate nodes labeled as cell types and to support network enrichment and interpretation of cell-specific biological functions.
}
\details{
The dataset includes a wide variety of cell types, from generic terms like "cell" to highly specialized cells such as "tuft cell of olfactory epithelium."
Obsolete terms are retained for ontology completeness but should be excluded in downstream functional analyses unless specifically required.

The annotations can be joined to graph-based analysis results using the \code{identifier} column, facilitating biological interpretation in network analysis.
