\title{Protein Annotations (UniProt-Based)}
\format{
A data frame with 194076 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the UniProt protein accession (e.g., "A0A023HJ61").}
\item{name}{The gene symbol or short name for the protein (e.g., "RAB4A"). This may be \code{NA} for uncharacterized or unnamed proteins.}
\item{description}{A textual description of the proteinâ€™s function or classification, including enzyme commission (EC) numbers, if available (e.g., "ATP synthase subunit a").}
}

\usage{
protein_annotation
}
\description{
A reference annotation table mapping protein identifiers to gene symbols and functional descriptions.
The dataset is derived primarily from UniProt and related sources, and is used within the tKOI framework to annotate nodes of type "Protein" in biological knowledge graphs.
}
\details{
This dataset supports the interpretation of graph-based analyses by providing biological context for protein nodes.
Descriptions are derived from automated or curated functional annotations such as RuleBase and ECO evidence codes.

The \code{identifier} column is intended to be used as a join key for protein-related nodes in the tKOI network output, while the \code{description} field adds depth to functional interpretation.
