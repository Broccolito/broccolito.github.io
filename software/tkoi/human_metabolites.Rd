\title{human_metabolites: Parsed Human Metabolite Metadata from HMDB}
\format{
A data frame with  rows and 4 columns:
\describe{
\item{name}{Metabolite name (character)}
\item{inchikey}{Standard InChIKey identifier (character)}
\item{chebi_id}{ChEBI ID with "CHEBI:" prefix, or NA (character)}
\item{chembl_id}{ChEMBL compound ID, or NA (character)}
}
}
\usage{
human_metabolites
}
\description{
A data frame containing key chemical identifiers for metabolites curated
from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). This dataset was constructed
by parsing the official HMDB XML export and selecting metabolite-level
identifiers relevant for downstream bioinformatics and network biology analyses.
}
\details{
\subsection{Description}{

Each row corresponds to a unique metabolite entry from HMDB. The following
columns are included:
\itemize{
\item \code{name}: The primary name of the metabolite as recorded in HMDB
\item \code{inchikey}: The standard InChIKey chemical structure identifier
\item \code{chebi_id}: The corresponding ChEBI identifier (when available), prefixed with \code{"CHEBI:"}
\item \code{chembl_id}: The corresponding ChEMBL compound ID (when available)
}

All values are character strings. Missing values are represented as \code{NA}.
}

\subsection{Use Cases}{

This table is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Mapping metabolites across chemical databases (InChIKey, ChEBI, ChEMBL)
\item Filtering knowledge graph nodes to retain only human-relevant compounds
\item Cross-referencing with metabolomics datasets or annotations
}
}

\subsection{Construction}{

This object was created by parsing \code{hmdb_metabolites.xml} using the \code{xml2} package.
Chemical identifiers were extracted using XPath queries for \verb{<inchikey>}, \verb{<chebi_id>},
and \verb{<chembl_id>}. ChEBI identifiers were post-processed to include the standard
\code{"CHEBI:"} prefix when present.
