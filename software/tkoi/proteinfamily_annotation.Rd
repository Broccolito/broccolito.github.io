\title{Protein Family Annotations (Pfam Clans)}
\format{
A data frame with 659 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the Pfam clan or protein family identifier (e.g., "CL0163").}
\item{name}{The short name of the protein family (e.g., "Calcineurin"). These often reflect structural, evolutionary, or functional groupings of related protein domains.}
}

}
\description{
A curated annotation table of protein families, primarily derived from Pfam clan classifications.
Each entry maps a protein family identifier to a short descriptive name, supporting the annotation of graph nodes
that represent protein families in the tKOI knowledge network.
}
\details{
Protein families group related domains based on common evolutionary origins, structure, or function.
This dataset allows high-level functional grouping of nodes in biological networks and supports annotation of gene products in systems biology and bioinformatics analyses.

The \code{identifier} field serves as a join key for nodes of type "ProteinFamily" in the tKOI framework.
