\format{
An igraph object where nodes and edges represent biological entities and their interactions. The node types included are:
\describe{
\item{Anatomy}{Nodes representing anatomical structures and systems.}
\item{BiologicalProcess}{Nodes for functional biological processes, such as signaling pathways.}
\item{CellType}{Nodes describing different cell types.}
\item{CellularComponent}{Nodes for subcellular structures, organelles, and macromolecular complexes.}
\item{ClinicalLab}{Nodes representing clinical measurements and diagnostic data.}
\item{Complex}{Nodes for molecular and protein complexes.}
\item{Compound}{Nodes for endogenous metabolites in human.}
\item{Disease}{Nodes for diseases and pathological conditions.}
\item{EC}{Nodes categorized by Enzyme Commission numbers.}
\item{Gene}{Nodes for genetic elements, such as genes and genetic markers.}
\item{MiRNA}{Nodes for microRNAs and their regulatory roles.}
\item{MolecularFunction}{Nodes describing molecular activities performed by gene products.}
\item{Pathway}{Nodes representing sequences of molecular interactions and reactions.}
\item{Protein}{Nodes for protein molecules.}
\item{ProteinDomain}{Nodes for specific structural or functional domains within proteins.}
\item{ProteinFamily}{Nodes for groups of evolutionarily related proteins.}
\item{PwGroup}{Nodes for pathway groups aggregating multiple related pathways.}
\item{Reaction}{Nodes for biochemical reactions and their participants.}

\description{
An igraph object representing a human-specific heterogeneous biological network.
}
\details{
This heterogeneous network integrates multiple biological datasets to represent complex relationships within the human system. It serves as the foundation for network-based analyses in the \code{tkoi} package, such as personalized PageRank calculations and enrichment analyses.
