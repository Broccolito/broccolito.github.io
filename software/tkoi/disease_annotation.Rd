\title{Disease Ontology (DO) Annotations}
\format{
A data frame with 10002 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the Disease Ontology ID (e.g., "DOID:0040003").}
\item{name}{The name of the disease (e.g., "benzylpenicillin allergy").}
\item{definition}{A detailed textual definition of the disease, including etiology, affected systems, or allergy triggers, often with references to biomedical sources.}
}
}
\source{

}
\usage{
disease_annotation
}
\description{
A structured annotation table mapping Disease Ontology (DOID) identifiers to human-readable disease names and definitions.
This dataset is used in the tKOI framework to annotate network nodes associated with disease terms, enabling interpretation of enriched or prioritized disease-related features in biological networks.
}
\details{
Disease Ontology (DO) provides a standardized, ontology-based representation of human diseases. This dataset allows integration of disease concepts into biological graphs and supports downstream analysis of disease associations.

The \code{identifier} column serves as a join key to nodes of type "Disease" in tKOI networks, while the \code{definition} column provides biological and clinical context.
