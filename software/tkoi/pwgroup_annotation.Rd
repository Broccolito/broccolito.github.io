\format{
A data frame with 6343 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the Reactome stable identifier (e.g., "reactome:R-HSA-9624419").}
\item{name}{A human-readable description of the interaction group or signaling unit (e.g., "EGFR:EGF-like ligands").}

\description{
A curated annotation table for grouped pathway interaction events from Reactome.
Each entry represents a molecular interaction or signaling complex involved in a pathway context, typically grouped by protein complexes or ligand-receptor interactions.
These pathway groupings support detailed annotation of graph nodes in the tKOI network that represent composite signaling units.
}
\details{
This dataset provides molecular resolution for pathway-associated interactions and groupings (e.g., dimerized receptors, ligand-bound complexes),
enhancing the interpretability of nodes labeled as "PwGroup" in tKOI analyses. These groups often represent intermediate or context-specific biochemical states within signaling cascades.

The \code{identifier} field can be used to join with graph nodes, while the \code{name} field is useful for labeling and summarizing pathway-level results.
