\title{Protein and Molecular Complex Annotations}
\format{
A data frame with 3318 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A numeric or character string serving as the unique ID for the complex (e.g., "2241498559").}
\item{name}{A descriptive name of the complex, including viral-host receptor assemblies or protein transcription factor complexes (e.g., "SARS-CoV-2 Spike - human ACE2 receptor complex").}
\item{description}{A detailed functional and mechanistic summary of the complex, often including molecular interactions, roles in signaling, and implications in infection or transcriptional regulation.}
}
}
\source{
Complex descriptions adapted from curated biological databases such as Reactome and literature sources.
}
\usage{
complex_annotation
}
\description{
A detailed annotation table of known molecular and protein complexes, including host-pathogen receptor-ligand assemblies and endogenous regulatory complexes.
Each entry provides a unique identifier, a descriptive name of the complex, and a rich textual definition outlining biological roles, composition, and functional significance.
}
\details{
This dataset is particularly useful for annotating graph nodes that represent biological complexes in systems-level analyses.
Examples include virus-receptor binding events relevant to infectious disease research and SMAD family transcriptional complexes involved in TGF-beta signaling.

The annotations can be joined to analysis outputs from \code{\link[tkoi]{run_tkoi}} using the \code{identifier} column.
