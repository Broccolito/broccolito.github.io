\title{Biochemical Reaction Annotations (KEGG-Based)}
\format{
A data frame with 24659 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{identifier}{A character string representing the KEGG reaction ID (e.g., "R04184").}
\item{name}{The reaction name or stoichiometric equation (e.g., "globoside N-acetylhexosaminohydrolase; ..."). This may be \code{NA} for reactions without an assigned label or formula.}
}

\usage{
reaction_annotation
}
\description{
A structured annotation table of biochemical reactions, primarily derived from KEGG reaction identifiers. Each entry maps a unique reaction ID to a human-readable reaction name or formula, representing enzymatic or spontaneous transformations of biological molecules.
This dataset supports annotation of nodes labeled as "Reaction" in the tKOI framework.
}
\details{
Reactions describe biochemical events such as substrate-to-product transformations catalyzed by enzymes or occurring spontaneously.
This dataset allows enrichment and interpretation of pathway-embedded biochemical steps, enhancing systems-level understanding of metabolic or signaling processes.

The \code{identifier} field enables joining with reaction nodes in tKOI network output, and the \code{name} column provides interpretability in reporting or visualization.
